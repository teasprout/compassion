We build a home for a single mother of three children. One of the days a local farm down the street, invited us to eat with them. We actually cut down the root we ate and picked all of the fruit as well. They wanted to feed us at no cost for helping the mother down the road. On the farm, cut out of the grass was a local saying “Pura Vida”. The literal meaning is pure life. It was a statement that all of Costa Ricans try to live by. Whenever I think of compassion I think of that farm family who fed us. Whenever I think of compassion, I think of building that home.

They hadn't and there were no missing pet ads for him, so considering the circumstanceds the vet said we could keep him.

The warm colors represent the warmth that an act of compassion fills all individuals involved with. A knot also symbolizes the strength that compassion can spark. Not only can compassion give a recipient the strength and support to carry on, a compassionate society will be stronger than a non-compassionate one.

642,"McEwen, Ashley",9th Grader,Bozeman High,Amanda Aaker,"The quote I used was originally from a tumblr blog post. The blog, biggest-gaudiest-patronuses, is filled with absurd humor and surprisingly deep quotes. The person who runs the blog, who fans have dubbed ""Gaud"", preaches self love and compassion. I chose this quote of theirs because sometimes we forget to love ourselves. In a world where you are taught that it can always be worse so we shouldn't complain, we stray away from dealing with our own struggles. We are told from a young age that loving yourself is selfish. Therefore, loving yourself is an act of anarchy. The background of my block represents my own personal theory on human emotion, suffering and trauma. I believe that whenever something negative happens in our lives and we are deeply impacted by it, we crack. Some people have few cracks, some are completely shattered. Most people hide their cracks. They wear a mask, hiding their imperfections. But no matter how you cover yourself, your cracks are still there. We can, however, repair our cracks, replace our missing pieces, through compassion.

4874,Tessa Jenzer,4th Grader,Monforton School,Marianne Filloux,I think compassion means to me is that you should help people  that have troubles and people that need help. My artwork shows: a park that has no people in it because the park is lonely. But then people will go over there and have fun. Also if kids play at the park and one is mean. Another kid can help the other kids. I learned: to always be compassionate at the park because you could have way more fun with happiness around. I want to be compassionate in the future by: helping kids at parks to be more careful and kind. ,,

I started crying. I was feeling sorry for myself while this man was fighting for a life. I ended up taking him to eat at one of the shops. When I asked if I could buy him lunch he said ""they wouldn't like that,"" implying that the ugly parts of our society had brainwashed him and myself. I learned that he felt ""unhuman"". How could we make someone feel unhuman as they're a human being? How dare us take that away from him! I knew from then on, I would always smile at the homeless driving past them on the corner. Maybe that simple act could remind them they're human. Remind them they are not invisible. What if we were all a tornado? As fast as a tornado can rip apart a city, society could rip apart our ugly parts. ""You don't have to move mountains. Simply fall in love with life"" Be a tornado of happiness, gratitude, and acceptance. You will change the world just by being a warm, kind hearted human being."" - Anita Krizzan",,

8809,Brandon Swenson,12,Bozeman High School,Rhyner,"Compassion is having the will to put others before yourself, to go above and beyond. My art work shows a bloomed flower, I painted that because the form of compassion that I see from it is since flowers are calm and gentle and beautiful, compassion is meant to be gentle one another and kind, and to seek out the beauty in every situation if it were to bad. I find myself compassionate because I help those in need, and I put others before me if necessary. To see people practice compassion I see trying to help out when someone is in need, or kindly letting people cross the crosswalk as your driving. Simple things can build up compassion.
",,
8816,Aubrey Johnson,12,Bozeman High School,Mrs. Rhyner,"Compassion is recognising the needs of another person and taking action to improve their situation without expecting anything in return. On my art block I painted two silhouetted figures locking hands, one full of cheerful colors and flowers and one full of dark colors and storm clouds. The flowers and bright colors from the first silhouette are reaching through the arms of the dark silhouette and spreading to it. I painted this image to show how spreading compassion can be as simple as giving encouragement, a listening ear, or your time to someone who needs it and trying to make their day a little better. In my life, I practice compassion by being a good listener and offering kind words to others. I often see people around me being compassionate by giving compliments and going out of their way to help someone who needs it.
",,
9704,Felicity Schlosser,12,bozeman High school ,Mrs Rhyner ,"Compassion is, when someone is there for you even when it is inconvenient for them. I drew two birds together on a branch because this shows how compassion can be shown in simple acts. I believe compassion isn't difficult to incorporate into our lives, it's a matter of choosing to show compassion or not. I show compassion by always having an open mind and heart to everyone around me, and do my best to be there when i’m needed.
",,
9703,Miranda Alexander,12,bozeman High school ,Rhyner,"Compassion is feeling how someone else feels and helping them every step of the way. I drew a rose because usually if someone is feeling bad in the hospital, you feel bad for them and end up bringing them flowers to help lift their spirits. I can teach others about compassion by having them volunteer somewhere to help out in the community and just to help them get involved. I am compassionate because i volunteer in the hospital which means i get to help the nurses out but i am allowed to talk to patients and sometimes that really helps them, especially if they are in there for awhile and are lonely. I see people practicing compassion in my life by being there for others when they aren’t well, like when my aunt had to go into emergency surgery and my mom took a flight to be there for her.",,
9725,Noah Schilke,12,bozeman High school ,Rhyner ,Compassion is going out of your way to make someone feel better. My painting shows a planet(supposed to look like earth) that is shaped like a heart to show that compassion is all over the world. Some people may think compassion is gone but it is all over the world. You can see compassion anywhere if you look hard enough. I’ve shown compassion by stopping what I’m doing to help some else out. I see other people go out of their way to put down whatever they have going on and help someone else in need.,,
8810,Caroline Goodman,12,Bozeman High School ,Rhyner,"Compassion is what can be defined as empathy and action mixed together, which can also change the outlook of a situation. In my art piece I attempted to draw a dandelion, my concept was to show how to spread compassion like a dandelion when it gets ready to send off it’s seeds. I think the best way to teach someone compassion is doing the little things everyday for everyone because people will notice how these small things can actually be impactful depending on that certain person’s mood. When I think about what I do to be compassionate to others, I try to use the same method everyday. I think that if you're able to take even the smallest amount of time of your day to help someone who is needing it, then it shows your selflessness because you're putting action behind the situation. Lastly when I see others doing compassion, a lot of people show it towards their friends but I think the most rewarding situations come from not personally knowing someone. This leads back to the idea of the dandelion where compassion needs to be sent out to everything/everyone around you.",,
7973,Pace Yoder,12,Bozeman High School ,Rhyner ,Compassion is a way to to be sympathetic to others by helping with others suffering. I painted an ecosystem where compassion is needed to continue the cycle. Anyone can be compassionate if they go out of their way to help others. I practice compassion by trying to help people with their issues instead of standing by idly. I think all people should show compassion especially if they notice something is wrong with others. Most people can be compassionate by doing simple things yet most do not realize that something small can change others positively.  ,,
9702,Eddy Alvarado,12,Bozeman High School ,Rhyner,So compassion is caring someone or something that can’t succeed without help kinda like teacher but in a personal level. So the artwork is someone who is compassion to this little seed and is planting it to the ground to grow and stuff. But with compassion the little seed becomes a tree and is striving in life due to the love and compassion the stick guy gave to the tiny seed. So this art piece I made shows the lengths compassion can go for anything and how successful something can be with help. So how am I compassionate well I help anyone who needs it cause it’s the right thing to do. The people who I see practices compassion is my grandma cause she is kind.,,

This is a very important idea to me because I work every day to love myself and others and to always be there for the people I care about.",,
9716,Megan Riffle,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is someone whos willing to care for a person who’s in need of help. I painted a flower with an ombre background because it shows that it’s hard to be upset when someone gives you a flower to show much they care for you. I could teach others that compassion is something everyone needs at least once in your life. I am a caring person in general and I make sure that I put others before myself when necessary. When people deal with personal issues and putting their all in for others.
",,
9715,Tyler Hampton,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is caring or concern for others in their hardships or misfortunes. In my artwork I drew someone picking up trash along a riverside, because when people think of compassion they only think about other people but not animals that we affect. Whenever I go fishing along the river there are beer cans, and trash everywhere, and the trash can kill the fish. I think that picking up trash is compassionate to our wildlife, and environment. The biggest person that I see in my life that is compassionate is my youth pastor, he takes time every day to make sure that everyone around him is ok. He practices compassion in my life by taking time every week to meet up with me and talk with me making sure that I am ok.",,
9701,Hailey Lachapelle,12,BHS,Rhyner,"For a dog, being pet is like receiving an affectionate lick from a pack member, it tells them they belong and are loved. In our quest for compassion it is easy to forget those who could not survive without us, especially if you've never had a pet. Offering to walk a neighbor’s dog while they are away, or taking a trip to the local shelter to share some lovin’ are simple acts of compassion that can drastically improve an animal’s life.
",,
8815,Quinn Gardner ,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is having the ability to feel empathy for another individual and then to act on that feeling. So rather than just contemplating what a person in a difficult situation is feeling, you go out of your way to actually help the person in need. I drew my piece to demonstrate how powerful compassion is when used in a community. My piece depicts a tree falling onto another tree symbolizing a friend in need leaning on a friend with a helping hand. Slowly over time the symbiotic relationship between the tree and its community, the forest life, will help the tree to regain its strength just as a community should do with damaged individuals. I try to be as open to compassion as possible going out of way to help people in simple dysfunctional situations such as a popped bike tire. Compassion is very important to the success of a happy community and I am proud to see compassion being demonstrated throughout our community.",,
8828,Madi Harris,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is one’s ability to feel sympathy for someone’s situation and do something in order to improve it. For my art piece I created a flower in a vase with a small note next to it. I drew this with the idea in mind that something as simple as a flower could brighten someone’s mood. Adding a note that may contain reasons why you like this person or even just a positive phrase could significantly change their mindset. It is important to learn the skill of being compassionate in order to spread it to many others and improve the community we live in. 
",,
8817,Ted Scott,12,Bozeman High School,Rhyner,"Compassion is when someone goes out of their way and takes the time to do something to help another person or thing. In order to represent this I depicted two people of different races reaching out to help one another. In addition the setting of this is in nature to represent a state of peace. If I were to teach others about compassion it would be that compassion will lead to a better world and peace. I demonstrate acts of compassion by giving rides to my siblings, which helps both my siblings and parents, and I help my teammates with problems outside of soccer. I notice people giving compliments to one another, asking to help one another, and being there for eachother in times of need. ",,
8826,Payton Smith,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is the act of listening, saying, or doing something to calm someone else's feelings when you truly have put yourself in their shoes and understand their feelings. My artwork is a rasta bowl of soup in the sky, representing many things. The Bowl of soup is symbolizing compassion as if when your mom takes care of you when you're sick. Rasta colors symbolize peace and happiness as in a form of compassion. I have learned that almost all compasion cost no money so we can all spread it around like a disease, in a good way.",,
8825,Garrett Johnnson,12,BHS,Rhyner,Compassion is caring and doing caring things for people. I drew two hands grabbing each other. It could be one person picking another up or whatever you want it to be. This could teach people to be there for others. I have told myself to always give money to homeless people on the side of the street. I see others starting programs or events to raise money for groups that are in need.,,
8827,Austin Clowes ,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is helping someone in need whether or not they ask you for help. For my compassion project I painted a bowl of soup. I painted this to symbolize the act of giving a sick or hungry person food to help them out of the kindness of your own heart. People practice compassion everyday it might go unnoticed but we all do compassionate things for people. For example payton has a broken foot, i could make him grab his own art supplies and computer but instead of just feeling bad that he is a cripple i get stuff for him.",,
8819,Daniel Davis,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is the act of empathy or sympathy toward someone and doing something to them to feel better. I drew a rain cloud over a dying flower to show compassion. The raincloud had sympathy for the flower dying, so it did something about it by raining on the flower to save its life. Showing compassion towards someone is very important because it will help them to get through the struggle they are in.",,
9713,Arthur Koster,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is the act of giving one's time and love in a selfless manner. I drew a silly monkey surrounded by surreal amounts of bananas. In order to make someone crack a smile and make their day better. I can simply teach others compassion, by being a role model. For example holding a door open or giving a blanket to someone who’s cold, demonstrating respect, practicing acceptance, etc. I’m compassionate by simply “listening” to what others have to say. Many times people take for granted simply taking the time to genuinely listen to somebody, and how far it goes to show someone that you care. I see others practice compassion in my life by looking out for each other like family, making sure everyone around you is doing great. Doing so by simply asking how someones day is or paying for the food of someone in line with you at the Supermarket. All and all Practicing compassion doesn’t haft to be anything gradious, Just show people that you appreciate them being alive, which can be nothing more than a hug.",,
8824,Joe St. John,12,BHS,Rhyner,"Compassion is anything you can do for another person. It doesn’t have to be a grand gesture, it just has to be going out of your way to help another.

900,Kenneth Eiden,Sophomore,Bozeman High School,Ms. Wilcox,"        Compassion can mean many things. For me, it means understanding what someone is going through, acknowledging their problems, and then actually trying to help them get through them. My Image is a picture of a boy in a hole surrounded by darkness and hardship. The boy feels hopeless and lost, and has no idea how to get out of the darkness. Then I drew another boy standing above the hole, in sunshine and birds, with a rope reaching down the hole. The rope he is holding is supposed to represent a figurative helping hand for the boy in the hole. 
	The boy above the hole is representing someone showing compassion for another. The boy above the hole understands that the other boy in the hole is stuck, he then acknowledges it, and then actually is trying to help him get out of the darkness and into the light, or out of the hole.
